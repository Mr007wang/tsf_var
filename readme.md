## Introduction
This project aims to offer the tools required to analyze and forecast time series using VAR models.

To generate synthetic data see GenTS and to find the best model for a given data see SolverTS.

## How to use
GenTS: ./gen -var N -dep N -instances N [-ivar N -idep N] [-noise R]
SolverTS: ./test [-training R] < dataFile


## Authors
This repository contains the source code of GenTS and SolverTS. Both projects are at early stages and under active development. The developer of the project is Alfonso L. Castaño, under the supervision of D. Giménez and J. Cuenca as part of the project *Desarrollo y estudio de algoritmos para la busqueda del mejor modelo econometrico en problemas de ciencias de la salud*.
